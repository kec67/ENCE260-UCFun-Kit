Start up:

Plug in two UC Fun Kits, type make program twice into the module.

When the title screen comes up, whoever wants to be the hider presses the navswitch down.

The blue light indicates who's turn it is, the hider always starts.


LIGHTS ON DISPLAY:

Your player character is the solid light.

If you are the hider: the seeker character will blink fast. It will blink dimmer when the seeker is moving and brighter when he has locked in his position.
If you are the seeker: the hider will blink slow. (if you can see him, conditions described below)

FIRST MOVE - HIDER:

You get the first move and on the first move you can move to any point on the board using the navswitch.
Push down to lock in your position, this will begin the seekers turn.

SEEKERS TURN:

You cannot see anything but yourself. Move anywhere on the board and push the navswitch down to lock in your position and end your turn.
Once you have ended your turn and if you are within 1 space of the hider's last position, their position will blink. (As a hint that the hider is close)


HIDERS TURN AFTER FIRST ROUND:

The seeker position will be shown. You can only move once, using the navswitch and only up/down/left/right. (Use that move wisely!)


WINNING CONDITIONS:

The seeker wins if he finds the hider, by being in the same position, within 6 rounds otherwise the hider wins!

:) = Win   :( = Lose
